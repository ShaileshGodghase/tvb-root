Modeling Epilepsy
=================


TVB can be used to model large-scale epileptic seizure dynamics.  Using
relevant neural mass models, TVB allows to ask multiple questions such as the
localisation of the epileptogenic zone or the validity of different
neuroimaging modalities to assess the epileptogenicity of a brain structure.
Here we will present an example of such a modelisation.

-------------------

Objectives
----------

The main goal of this tutorial is to provide a clear understanding of how we
can reproduce clinically relevant senarios such as the modelisation of
propagation of an epileptic seizure in the human brain, electrical stimulation
of a brain region that can trigger a seizure, or surgical resection of brain
regions.

We will be using the ModelingEpilepsy project. You can download the ModelingEpilepsy.zip file
in the `TVB sharing area <http://www.thevirtualbrain.org/tvb/zwei/client-area/public>`_.
We’ll only go through the necessary steps required to reproduce these simulations,
along with the relevant outline.  You can always start over, click along and/or try to
change parameters.  We will use the default subject connectivity matrix and surface.

-------------------

Exploring the Epileptor model
-----------------------------

The Epileptor is a phenomenological neural mass model able to reproduce
epileptic seizure dynamics such as recorded with intracranial EEG electrodes
(see Jirsa_et_al_).  Before launching any simulations, we will have a look at
the phase space of the Epileptor model to better understand its dynamics. We
will use the phase plane interactive tool.

1. Go to *Simulator >* |burst_menu| *> Phase plane* and select the
   :math:`\mathbf{Epileptor}` model.

2. Look at the phase space. We have here the first population (variables
   :math:`y_0` in abscissa and :math:`y_1` in ordinate). The left most
   intersection of the nullcline defines a stable fixed point, representing the
   interictal state,  whereas the rightmost intersection is the center of a
   limit cycle, being the ictal state. Both states are separated by a
   separatrix, as you can see by drawing different trajectories in this phase
   space (left click on the figure).

3. You can also look at other variables in the phase space, such as
   the second population :math:`y_3`/:math:`y_4`, responsible for the interictal 
   spikes in the Epileptor model. Change the lower and upper bound of the axis 
   to see the phase space correctly.

4. You can continue to play along to explore the dynamics of this model.  For
   instance, try changing the number of *integration steps*, or choosing a
   **HeunStochastic** *integrator* and varying the scaling of the noise
   (parameter *D*).

-------------------

Region-based modeling of a temporal lobe seizure
------------------------------------------------

We will model  temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) using the Default TVB Subject.
Here, using the tools in *Set up Region model*, we will set different values of
epileptogenicity (:math:`x_0` parameter in the Epileptor) according to the
region positions, thereby introducing heterogeneities in the network
parameters. We will set the right limbic areas (right hippocampus (rHC),
parahippocampus (rPHC) and amygdala (rAMYG)) as epileptic zones. We will also
add two lesser epileptogenic regions: the inferior temporal cortex (rTCI) and
the ventral temporal cortex (rTCV).

First, we will configure the different parameter regimes we will use. Go to
the *Simulator* page, click on the |burst_menu| *> Phase plane*, in *Parameter
configuration name* give the name **Other Nodes**, select the **Epileptor**
*model*, set :math:`\mathbf{x_0=-2.4}`, and click on *Save new parameter configuration*
on the right menu. Repeat the operation using the name **Epileptogenic zone**
with :math:`\mathbf{x_0=-1.6}`, and then again using the name **Propagation zone**
with :math:`\mathbf{x_0=-1.8}`. For each of these set :math:`\mathbf{r=0.00015}`.
All the other model parameters are the default ones and are given in the following table.

===============   =======
Model parameter    Value
---------------   -------
 :math:`Iext`       3.1
 :math:`Iext2`      0.45
 :math:`slope`      0.0
===============   =======

1. Now we will set up the different spatial configurations of these parameters.
   Go back to *Simulator > Simulation Cockpit* and keep clicking on the *Next*
   button until you reach the model fragment. Click on *Set up region Model*.
   On the right of *New selection*, choose a name, such as **Epileptogenic Zone**
   and select the nodes rHC, rPHC, and rAMYG, then click on the  *Save* button.
   You can use the |unselect_all_nodes| button to unselect all nodes and |select_all_nodes|
   to select all nodes. Add another new selection having the name *Propagation Zone*
   with the rTCI and rTCV nodes, and another one with the name *Other Nodes* selection
   with all nodes but rHC, rPHC, rAMYG, rTCI, and rTCV.

 
2. Now we will assign our parameter configurations to our spatial selections.
   In the same window, in *Select model configuration* select **Epileptor -
   Epileptogenic Zone**, select you precedent *Epileptogenic Zone*
   configuration, and click on *Apply to selected nodes*. A green label should
   appear on the right of the nodes assigned. Repeat the operation for the
   *Propagation Zone* and *Other Nodes*, then don't forget to *Submit Region
   Parameters* on the right menu, which will bring you back to the Simulator
   panel. You can check that your choices have been saved if you see a list of
   parameters in front of the *X0* parameter for the **Epileptor** model.

.. figure:: figures/ModelingEpilepsy_ParameterChoice.png

   :scale: 60%
  
3. We will now configure the simulation parameters.  In the *Simulator Cockpit* panel,
   choose a **Difference** *Long-range coupling function* with
   :math:`\mathbf{a=1.0}`. We will add a  permittivity coupling and a coupling
   on the time scale of spike-wave events. For this set :math:`\mathbf{K_s=-0.2}`
   and :math:`\mathbf{K_f=0.1}`. As state variables choose :math:`\mathbf{x2-x1;y2}`.
   Choose a **Stochastic Heun** *integration scheme*, set the *integration step size* to
   **0.05 ms** and an **additive noise** with :math:`\mathbf{D=[0.0, 0.0, 0.0,
   0.0003, 0.0003, 0.0]}` (we add noise only on the second population).
  
4. For the *monitors*, we choose a **Temporal average**, an **EEG** and an
   **Intracerebral / Stereo Eeg** monitor. For all three monitors choose the
   state variables :math:`\mathbf{x2-x1;y2}` (this corresponds to first LFP signal, and second
   the slow dynamics of the Epileptor). Choose also the right *Projection
   matrix*, *Region mapping* and *Sensors* for each monitor, and a *samplng
   period* of **1 ms**. 
   
5. Choose a *simulation length* of **6000ms**.

6. Visualize the region time series using the *Time SeriesVisualizer (SVG/d3)*. Click on
   *Select Input Signals* and select all the regions. From this same menu, you
   can select which state variables of interest will be displayed. For
   instance, visualize :math:`x_2-x_1`. You will need to increase the scaling
   by clicking on |bm|. Use the mouse to zoom in and out in the time series area.

   :scale: 30%

7. Now click on |bm|, select the EEG time series, and *Update the Visualizer*.
   Chnage the scaling and the number of channels.

8. Repeat the operation for the SEEG time series, but select only the
    electrodes TB1, A1, B1, C1, and GPH which are in the right temporal lobe.

9. Visualize the time series using the *Brain Activity Visualizer*.
    You will need to increase the rendering speed (timesteps per Frame)
    by clicking on |bm|.

Modeling surgical resection
---------------------------

Surgical resection is used for around 20% of epileptic patient whose seizures
are drug- resistant. We will simulate the hypothetic case of a surgical
resection of the amygdala and the hippocampus, but leaving the parahippocampal
cortex.

1. Go to *Connectivity > Large scale Connectivity*. Click on the *Launch* button.
   All nodes of the connectivity matrix are already selected.

2. Click  on *Q1* to go to Quadrant 4, and click on rAMYG and rHC to unselect
   these nodes if they are not already unselected.  Give the name **Resection**
   at the right of *Large Scale Matrix* and save it by clicking on |star|.
   Here we just created a new connectivity matrix while deleting all edges
   connected to the right amygdala and hippocampus.

.. figure:: figures/ModelingEpilepsy_ResectedMatrix.png
   :alt: Resected connectivity matrix
   :scale: 40%

3. Go back to *Simulator* and copy the *Region\_TemporalLobe* simulation.

4. Choose the Resection connectivity matrix.

5. Go in *Set up region model*, and apply the dynamics of OtherNodes to rAMYG
   and rHC.  (i.e. we replace the dynamics of the resected node by a stable
   node).

The results are given in *resection_Region_TemporalLobe*.


6. Click on *Results*, then TimeSeries and visualize the spatial average time
   series with the a Time Series visualizer. Don’t forget to increase
   the *Scaling* and *Select all* channels.

Triggering a seizure by stimulation
-----------------------------------

We are now going to model an electric stimulation and trigger a seizure. We set
the whole brain to non-epileptogenic but close to the threshold:

1. Go to *stimulus > Region Stimulus*

2. Give a name to the new stimulus

3. Choose a **PulseTrain** stimulation in time with parameters given in the following table:

===================   =======
Temporal parameters    Value
-------------------   -------
 :math:`onset`        2000.0 
 :math:`tau`           20.0
 :math:`T`            4000.0
 :math:`amp`           10.0
===================   =======


.. figure:: figures/ModelingEpilepsy_stimulation.png
   :alt: Stimulation pattern 
   :scale: 50%


4. Click on *Set Region Scaling*, select the **Propagation Zone** nodes, and
   apply a scaling of 1.0 , and click on *Save New Stimulus on Region* in the
   right menu.

5.  Go to simulator and copy the former simulation.

6.  Choose the *Stim_PropagationZone* stimulus.

7. Visualize the time series, zoom in to better see the effect of the stimulation.
